    "“In computer programming, an application programming interface (API) is a set of subroutine definitions, protocols, and tools for building software and applications. A good API makes it easier to develop a program by providing all the building blocks, which are then put together by the programmer.”  \n",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Luckily there are friendlier versions ...\n",
    "“... an API provides you with data its programmers have made available to outside users …”  \n",
    "“... they expose endpoints …” meaning “they publish a portion of the language they’ve used to build their program.”  \n",

    "\"The developers wrote some code into their server that lets you access some of the data if you ask the question in the right way.\"  \n",
